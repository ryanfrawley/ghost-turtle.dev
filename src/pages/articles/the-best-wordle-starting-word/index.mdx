Wordle is one of those games that took our post-pandemic brains by storm. It captivated (and distracted) millions around the world, at a time when we needed it. I remember sharing my results with friends and family, and feeling a competitive spark to beat the puzzle in fewer guesses than them. So naturally, my engineering instincts kicked as I challenged myself to find the best starting word.

All of the code for this article is available on my <a href={`${GITHUB}/wordle`}>GitHub</a>.

## An Overview of Wordle

*(Feel free to skip this section if you already know the rules.)*

Wordle is a guessing game. Your task is to guess the random 5-letter word of the day, by entering one guess at a time, up to a total of 6 times. Each time you guess a word, any letters that your guess has in common with the answer will be revealed in either yellow or green: yellow if the letter is correct, but not the position, and green if both the letter and position are correct. Because each guess eliminates future possibilities, it's important to use a good starting word. For example, you wouldn't want to start with a word like `ZULUS`, as it has the uncommon letter `Z`, and a repeating vowel `U`.

## The First Guess
The first guess is the most important guess. This board is a blank canvas, waiting for you to starting eliminating possibilities. In order to come up with the ideal starting word, we need to find a word that has the highest probability of having matching letters out of a randomly chosen 5-letter word. To do this, we can start by analyzing the frequencies of each letter, as well as their positions.

```
// Letters sorted in frequency-order
[
  [ 'a', 8392 ], [ 'e', 7800 ],
  [ 's', 6537 ], [ 'o', 5219 ],
  [ 'r', 5143 ], [ 'i', 5067 ],
  [ 'l', 4246 ], [ 't', 4189 ],
  [ 'n', 4043 ], [ 'u', 3361 ],
  [ 'd', 2811 ], [ 'c', 2744 ],
  [ 'y', 2521 ], [ 'm', 2494 ],
  [ 'p', 2299 ], [ 'h', 2284 ],
  [ 'b', 2089 ], [ 'g', 1971 ],
  [ 'k', 1743 ], [ 'f', 1238 ],
  [ 'w', 1171 ], [ 'v', 878 ],
  [ 'z', 474 ],  [ 'j', 376 ],
  [ 'x', 361 ],  [ 'q', 139 ]
]
```

Those of you who watched Wheel of Fortune might notice that the first few letters mostly match up with the most popular choice in the final round, where contestents have to choose 4 consonants and 1 vowel: `R L S T N E`. Though `A` appears to be more common than `E`, this is only because we're limiting ourselves to 5-letter words. If we compare to any length word, we find that `E` is over 27.2% more common than `A`!
